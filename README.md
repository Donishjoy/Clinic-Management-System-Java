# Clinic-Management-System-Java
The Clinic Management System is a JDBC project designed to manage patient and 
consultation records. Usually, when a patient arrives for the consultation the patient 
registration and the consultation details must be manually recorded using pen and paper, 
which is difficult task and time consuming job. Moreover, the physical copies of these 
documents also have to be handled carefully where there are also the risk of losing these 
records. So “Clinic Management System” introduces a way to store and manage these records 
digitally. The entire consultation process is digitally recorded and the retrieval of these stored 
data is really an easier process. With this system, it is possible to view all the patients who 
consulted the doctor by filtering them according to the dates they visited. During the 
consultation process the doctor can examine the patient and the findings are recorded using 
this system. The prescription details including the medicine details and the way in which it 
must be used can also be recorded. Besides, the doctor can easily track the patient’s visit 
history to make the examination process much easier. The prescription can be made available 
in a pdf format and can be shared with the patient and a hardcopy can also be generated if 
needed. The simple design and user interface makes it easier to navigate through the system 
and use the functionalities without any problem. Hence “Clinic Management System“ ensures 
an efficient and reliable way to handle patient records and manage them easily.
